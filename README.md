# üï∞Ô∏è ChronoDocs

**The janitor for your AI slop.**

AI agents are great at generating docs ‚Äî and very bad at organizing them.

ChronoDocs quietly cleans up after them: numbering files, tracking real changes, and generating changelogs so you can focus on shipping, not sorting markdown.

---

## üß† Why ChronoDocs?

When working with AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.), your docs folder can turn into a landfill of half-thoughts and redundant drafts:

- Randomly named files (`final_v2_REALLY_FINAL.md`)
- Zero chronological order
- No clue what changed or why
- Impossible to follow the AI‚Äôs ‚Äúthought process‚Äù

ChronoDocs fixes that mess by:

- üï∞Ô∏è **Auto-numbering** files (`00-`, `01-`, `02-`, etc.)
- üîç **Hash-based change tracking** ‚Äî detects real edits, not just timestamp noise
- üßæ **Auto-generated changelogs** ‚Äî with git status integration
- üßò **Fully autonomous** ‚Äî runs in the background, no manual cleanup required

Perfect for: **AI pair programming**, **agent-generated documentation**, **sprint histories**, and **autonomous development workflows**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Requires **Python 3.10+**

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install git+https://github.com/asuworks/chrono-docs

# Or with pip
pip install git+https://github.com/asuworks/chrono-docs
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Create a config file** (`.chronodocs.yml`) in your project root:

```yaml
phase_dir_template: ".devcontext/progress/{phase}"
watch_paths: ["."]
ignore_patterns: [".git/", "node_modules/", ".venv/"]
```

2. **Start the watcher** for your current phase:

```bash
chronodocs start --phase feature-development
```

This spins up two watchers:

- üß© **Phase watcher:** keeps your `.devcontext/progress/{phase}/` folder tidy
- üëÄ **Sentinel watcher:** tracks the whole repo and logs changes to `change_log.md`

3. **Add files** to your phase directory:

```bash
echo "# Design Notes" > .devcontext/progress/feature-development/design.md
echo "# API Spec" > .devcontext/progress/feature-development/api.md
```

ChronoDocs instantly renames them:

- `00-design.md`
- `01-api.md`

‚ú® Clean. Ordered. Predictable.

## üß≠ Usage

### Common Commands

```bash
# Start both watchers (recommended for active development)
chronodocs start --phase my-phase

# One-time cleanup (no watching)
chronodocs reconcile --phase my-phase

# Preview renames without applying
chronodocs reconcile --phase my-phase --dry-run

# Generate a changelog report
chronodocs report --output changelog.md
```

### What Gets Created

| File                   | Purpose                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `.creation_index.json` | Tracks file creation order    |
| `.update_index.json`   | Hash map of content changes   |
| `change_log.md`        | Human-readable change history |

## ü§ñ Teaching Your AI Assistant

To get the best results, give your AI agent a few house rules:

```markdown
# Documentation Rules

IMPORTANT: NEVER create documentation files unless explicitly asked.

All documentation should go in `.devcontext/progress/{phase}/`

## ChronoDocs Behavior

ChronoDocs automatically renames docs in `.devcontext/progress/{phase}/`
to `NN-<name>` (00-, 01-, 02-, etc.) based on when they were created.

**Never add numeric prefixes yourself.** Just create:

- ‚úÖ `architecture.md`
- ‚ùå `00-architecture.md`

Don‚Äôt edit `.creation_index.json` or rely on prefix numbers in links.
ChronoDocs manages that automatically.

Numbering always starts at 00.

## Current Phase

We are now in `phase_xyz`:
ALL GENERAL PROJECT DOCUMENTATION MUST BE STORED IN `.devcontext/progress/phase_xyz/`
```

This teaches your AI:

- Where to put files
- To ignore prefixes
- To play nice with the watcher
- To stop fighting your directory structure

---

## üß© Configuration

Example `.chronodocs.yml`:

```yaml
phase_dir_template: ".devcontext/progress/{phase}"
watch_paths: ["src/", "docs/", ".devcontext/"]
ignore_patterns: [".git/", "*.tmp", "__pycache__/"]
debounce:
    phase: 2000 # Wait 2s after file changes
    root: 3000
report:
    group_by: "updated_day_then_folder"
    extensions: [".md", ".py"]
```

ChronoDocs watches your chaos and politely waits a few seconds before tidying up.

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

Contributions welcome!
ChronoDocs was built to scratch a very specific AI-dev itch ‚Äî if it scratches yours too, join in:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Install pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    uv tool install pre-commit
    pre-commit install
    ```
4. Make your changes (hooks auto-format on commit)
5. Add tests for new functionality
6. Submit a pull request

**Pre-commit hooks** automatically run `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` on every commit to maintain code quality.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**Partially vibe-coded!**
ChronoDocs was co-developed with AI tools ‚Äî which means it was born in chaos and trained to clean it.
It works beautifully in daily use, but there may still be a few crumbs under the rug. PRs welcome.
