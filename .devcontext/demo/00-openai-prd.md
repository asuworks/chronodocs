# ChronoDocs — Product Requirements Document (CLI: `chronodocs`)

> **Tone / meta:** This document intentionally avoids rigid prescriptions. It provides options, trade-offs, and guidance for a future, more capable AI implementer (future-you). Treat these as constraints and starting points — refine, refactor, or change them where real-world evidence or superior judgment suggests doing so.

---

## 0 — Executive summary (what this file is)

This PRD adapts your original design into a standalone CLI tool named **`chronodocs`** (command: `chronodocs`) and then expands into a comprehensive PRD for an AI implementer tasked with building it with a strong testing suite, modular architecture, rich outputs, and safe behavior.

Short intent: build a local repo-level watcher + CLI that keeps documentation files ordered by stable creation order, tracks actual content updates via hashes, and produces human-friendly Markdown change-logs. The environment includes an autonomous developer AI that will create and modify docs — ChronoDocs must keep order, repair mistakes, and provide clear change summaries.

---

# Part A — Adjusted product PRD: `chronodocs` (standalone CLI)

## 1 — Purpose & intent

**High-level intent**

`chronodocs` is an autonomous, robust, and maintainable CLI daemon + utilities that:

- Ensures documentation files in repo phase directories are ordered by numeric prefixes (`00-…`, `01-…`) using a stable creation index.
- Tracks real content changes using content hashes and records precise content update timestamps.
- Generates human-readable Markdown change logs that surface repository activity (grouped, filtered, with git status, human dates, colored status markers).
- Runs continuously as a watcher, carefully debounced and guarded to avoid feedback loops and noisy rebuilds.
- Is modular, testable, observable, secure, and designed for maintainability and extension by future agents.

**Why build this**

- Keep docs discoverable and chronologically stable while other agents/humans edit files.
- Prevent accidental reordering from flaky filesystem timestamps or editor behaviors.
- Provide reproducible change logs for reviews, CI, and release notes.
- Serve as a safety/repair layer for an autonomous developer AI that may create, rename, or misname documentation files.

**Scope**

- Local repo-level daemon + small CLI utilities:
    - Watch and reconcile numeric prefixes in configured phase directories.
    - Maintain `.creation_index.json` and `.update_index.json`.
    - Generate change-log Markdown reports.

- Excludes: enterprise orchestration, remote UI, or conversions to other doc systems — but should be extensible.

---

## 2 — User-facing capabilities (CLI & behavior)

**Primary commands**

`chronodocs` CLI (subcommands and flags):

- `chronodocs watch` — start watchers (root + per-phase) in foreground; configurable debounce & logging.
    - `--dry-run` (report planned renames, no writes)
    - `--log-format json`
    - `--config ./chronodocs.yml`

- `chronodocs reconcile --phase <phase_dir>` — idempotent reconcile run for a single phase (or `--all`).

- `chronodocs generate --output change_log.md [--group-by updated_day|created_day|folder] [--ext .md --ext .py]` — generate Markdown change log based on git status + indices.

- `chronodocs status [--phase <phase>]` — show current indices, last-run times, metrics.

- `chronodocs explain-config` — human-readable explanation of active config resolution.

**Watcher behaviors**

- Root watcher: recursive over configured top-level paths; debounced trigger to schedule change-log generation.
- Phase watcher: non-recursive; watches a specific phase directory `./.devcontext/progress/{phase}/` (or configured path) and triggers `reconcile_prefixes`.
- Both watchers: honor `should_ignore_path()` semantics and a `SELF_IGNORE` list to avoid feedback loops.

**Indices & persistence**

- `.creation_index.json` — maps inode/dev or stable key → recorded creation time + filename canonical mapping.
- `.update_index.json` — maps prefixed filename → `{ hash, last_content_update }`.
- Indices written atomically (temp file -> rename). Default `.gitignore` entries recommended (opt-in behavior).

**Reconciler (core)**

- `reconcile_prefixes(phase_dir)`:
    - Load indices, list files (non-recursive), compute or update stable creation keys, compute content hashes, detect content updates, produce required renames to numeric prefixes (temp-rename then finalize).
    - Debounce and use a phase-level lock to avoid concurrent reconciles.
    - Return summary: `{ renamed: [...], errors: [...], update_index_changes: {...} }`.

**Change-log generator**

- Scans `git status --porcelain -z` and falls back to filesystem dates where necessary.
- Produces Markdown report with columns: File (relative link from report), Status (colored dot + text), Created, Updated.
- Supports grouping, filtering by extension, and sorting options.
- Excludes configured items: `.git`, `node_modules`, watcher outputs (default).
- Optionally emits JSON-lines machine events.

**Integration**

- `make change_log` or CLI wrapper `git-changes-report` can call generator.
- Watcher schedules `chronodocs generate` on root changes with debounce; files written by generator are ignored by watcher to avoid loops.
- Config file `.chronodocs.yml` or `.chronodocs.json` at repo root defines behavior and ignores.

**Extensibility hooks**

- Plugin interface to add outputs (JSON, CSV), remote publishing (wiki, artifact store), or PR automation.

---

## 3 — Non-functional requirements

- **Modularity:** clearly scoped modules: `config`, `watcher_root`, `watcher_phase`, `reconciler`, `creation_index`, `update_index`, `change_log_generator`, `git_helpers`, `cli`, `tests`, `observability`.
- **Testability:** unit + integration + property tests; deterministic fixtures; fakes for FS & git; CI runnable.
- **Observability:** structured logs (plain or JSON), metrics (`reconcile_count`, `reconcile_duration_seconds`, `change_log_runs`, `errors_total`), last-run timestamps.
- **Robustness:** avoid race conditions and self-trigger loops; use atomic renames; hold phase locks.
- **Performance:** low idle CPU; configurable debounce windows; handle thousands of docs with acceptable memory/CPU.
- **Portability:** best-effort on Linux/macOS/Windows; gracefully degrade birthtime features when unsupported.
- **Security:** never execute untrusted code; avoid leaking secrets; limit watcher scope.
- **Usability:** discoverable CLI, helpful defaults, and an `explain-config` command.

---

## 4 — Architecture & modules (recommended)

Top-level Python package (example): `chronodocs/`

### Modules (files/namespaces)

- `chronodocs.config` — config resolution (file, env, CLI overrides). Keys: `phase_dirs`, `ignore_patterns`, `group_by_default`, `make_cmd`, `debounce_phase`, `debounce_root`, `self_ignore`.
- `chronodocs.git_helpers` — porcelain parsing, `git log` fallback utilities, helper to run git safely.
- `chronodocs.indices.creation_index` — read/write `.creation_index.json`, keying strategies (inode+dev or name fallback), collision handling.
- `chronodocs.indices.update_index` — read/write `.update_index.json`, hashing, schema migration helpers.
- `chronodocs.reconciler` — `reconcile_prefixes(phase_dir)` implementation; atomic renames; `compute_stable_ctime`, `compute_file_hash`.
- `chronodocs.watcher.phase_watcher` — per-phase non-recursive watcher with debounce & lock.
- `chronodocs.watcher.root_watcher` — root-level recursive watcher with ignore rules and scheduled change-log calls.
- `chronodocs.change_log` — generator that composes markdown, groups, filters, and writes report.
- `chronodocs.cli` — Click/argparse CLI glue, logging setup, metrics registration.
- `chronodocs.tests` — unit, integration, e2e tests and test fixtures.
- `chronodocs.utils` — atomic write utilities, path helpers, time formatting.

### Interfaces & contracts

- `reconcile_prefixes(phase_dir) -> ReconcileResult` contract: idempotent output with `renamed`, `errors`, `update_index_changes`.
- `schedule_generate_change_log()` contract: debounce-only; should not block main thread for long.
- `should_ignore_path(path: Path) -> bool`: pure & testable.

---

## 5 — Data formats & persistence

**`.creation_index.json`** (example schema):

```json
{
    "ino:12345-dev:2050": {
        "key": "ino:12345-dev:2050",
        "filename": "design_notes.md",
        "recorded_ctime": 1698790000.123,
        "inode": 12345,
        "dev": 2050
    },
    "name:README.md": {
        "key": "name:README.md",
        "filename": "README.md",
        "recorded_ctime": 1698790100.456
    }
}
```

**`.update_index.json`** (example schema):

```json
{
    "00-design_notes.md": {
        "hash": "b2d...f",
        "last_content_update": "2025-10-30T15:14:19Z"
    },
    "01-api_spec.md": {
        "hash": "c9a...0",
        "last_content_update": "2025-10-29T12:03:02Z"
    }
}
```

**`change_log.md`** — Markdown tables grouped per `group_by` option, links URL-encoded and relative.

---

## 6 — Testing strategy (comprehensive)

> The future implementer should expand tests as new edge cases are discovered.

### 6.1 Unit tests

- `should_ignore_path` permutations.
- `compute_file_hash` with various encodings, binary/text files.
- `load/save` for indices with valid, missing, and corrupted JSON.
- `compute_stable_ctime` using mocked `os.stat` and simulated git metadata.
- `git status` parsing (`--porcelain -z`) edge cases: renames, staged+modified, deleted, untracked.
- Markdown generation output formatting tests.

### 6.2 Integration tests

- Temporary git repo fixture:
    - Init repo, commit initial files, create staged/untracked/modified files, run `chronodocs generate` and assert rows & statuses.

- Reconcile test:
    - Create unordered files in phase dir, run `reconcile_prefixes`, assert prefixes, .creation_index.json and .update_index.json updated as expected.

- Watcher test:
    - Run watcher in a subprocess, simulate FS events (touch/write/rename), assert debounced behavior and single `generate` invocation.
    - Verify no self-trigger loops when generator writes files.

### 6.3 Property & fuzz tests

- Random filenames, unicode, very long names, special chars.
- Rapid event bursts to ensure debounce resilience.

### 6.4 End-to-end smoke tests

- Start watcher, run simulate autonomous agent creating docs, verify indices and change_log reflect intended behavior.

### 6.5 CI & reproducibility

- Run tests on Linux and macOS runners (Windows optional). Use deterministic timestamps via time-freezing libraries or mocks.

---

## 7 — Observability & telemetry

- **Logs:** structured JSON optional; human-friendly default.
- **Metrics:** `reconcile_count`, `reconcile_duration_seconds`, `change_log_runs`, `change_log_duration_seconds`, `errors_total`.
- **Health endpoint (optional):** simple HTTP server exposing last reconcile time, last change_log time.
- **Debug mode:** `--dry-run` reports planned actions without executing them.

---

## 8 — Security & safety

- Avoid shell injections; use `subprocess.run([...])` with lists.
- Limit watcher scope to configured directories — do not default to `/` or entire filesystem.
- Recommend adding index files to `.gitignore` by default but make that opt-in and documented.
- Write files atomically (temp file + rename) to prevent partial reads.
- Document symlink behavior (resolve vs. ignore) and default to safe behavior (do not follow symlinks outside phase dir).

---

## 9 — UX and CLI examples

**Generate change log (one-off):**

```bash
# default grouping by updated_day
chronodocs generate -o ./.devcontext/progress/phase_test_docs_watcher/change_log.md

# filter by extension and group by folder
chronodocs generate -o change_log.md --group-by folder --ext .md --ext .py
```

**Run watcher (foreground):**

```bash
chronodocs watch --config ./chronodocs.yml
# or run as a background service via systemd / supervisor
```

**Reconcile now:**

```bash
chronodocs reconcile --phase .devcontext/progress/phase_test_docs_watcher
```

**Status:**

```bash
chronodocs status --phase current
```

**Example change log snippet:**

```md

## 10 — Deliverables & milestones (suggested)

**M0 — Design**

- Finalize config shape & module boundaries.
- Create test plan & fixtures.

**M1 — Core implementation**

- Implement `reconciler`, `creation_index`, `update_index`.
- Implement `change_log` generator with git parsing.
- Unit tests.

**M2 — Watchers**

- Implement `phase` and `root` watchers with debouncing/locks.
- Integration tests (watcher + reconcile + generate).

**M3 — Polishing**

- Logging, metrics, health endpoint, packaging, CLI ergonomics.
- CI integration & cross-platform tests.

**M4 — Extras**

- Additional outputs (JSON, CSV).
- Optional web UI or API.

---

## 11 — Acceptance criteria

- Unit coverage ≥ 85% for core modules (suggested).
- E2E tests that simulate edits produce:
    - Updated `.creation_index.json` and `.update_index.json` inside phase folder.
    - Single `change_log` generation per burst (debounce verified).
    - No persistent feedback loop where `chronodocs generate` retriggers itself indefinitely.

- Generated `change_log.md` meets formatting rules (columns + grouping), links are relative, statuses match git semantics.
- `reconcile_prefixes` is idempotent — repeated runs w/o source changes leave no modifications.

---

## 12 — Open design decisions / Deferred choices

I intentionally leave these open so future implementer can pick the best option after experimentation.

1. **Index keying** — inode-based keys vs. relative-path keys for `.update_index.json`.
   _Suggested:_ Use inode+dev internally with a canonical relative-path mapping for portability.

2. **Default watch scope** — full repo vs. curated list of top-level folders.
   _Suggested:_ Start curated: `docs`, `.devcontext/progress`, `src` with `--watch-all` opt-in.

3. **Collision handling** for renames — fail, overwrite, or suffix policy.
   _Suggested:_ Safe overwrite with warning by default; configurable policy.

4. **Persistence format** — JSON vs. SQLite.
   _Suggested:_ JSON for simplicity; choose SQLite if concurrency/scale demands it.

5. **Timestamps source** — trust git log for creation times vs. FS birthtime.
   _Suggested:_ Prefer git where available; fallback to FS times.

6. **Binary files behavior**
   _Suggested:_ Track all files by hash but allow exclusion for large binaries.

---

## 13 — Usage guidance for developer agent (system prompt snippet)

This snippet is intended to be placed into the autonomous developer agent's system prompt so it understands how to treat docs in the repo.

```
# Documentation
IMPORTANT: NEVER create documentation files, unless explicitly asked to do so.

Project-wide documents should be stored in `./docs/` using 2-digit numeric prefixes like:
- 00-PLAN.md
- 01-IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.md
- 02-SOME-FIX.md

Module/feature/test/fix docs belong in related folders.

## Docs Watcher Behavior

Docs watcher auto-renames files in ./.devcontext/progress/{phase}/ to NN-<name> (00-, 01-, …) based on stable creation order.
Never add numeric prefixes yourself — create/update docs without them (e.g. architecture.md).
The watcher tracks creation order in .creation_index.json; do not edit it.

Don’t reference prefixes in links or code; use base names only.

Excludes change_log.md and hidden files.

Numbering always starts at 00.

Expect filenames to change automatically after creation; do not try to preserve numeric order manually.

## Current Phase
We are now in {current_phase}: ALL GENERAL PROJECT DOCUMENTATION MUST BE STORED IN .devcontext/progress/{current_phase}/
```

> Note: the developer agent should be conservative about creating docs unless explicitly instructed. ChronoDocs will handle prefixing and ordering.

---

## 14 — Identity / branding (kept from original)

- CLI: `chronodocs`
- Emoji identity: 🕰️ or 👁️
- Log prefix example:

```
2025-11-01 10:22:03 [ChronoDocs] 👁️  Watching phase_7b — order intact.
2025-11-01 10:22:04 [ChronoDocs] 🧭  Reconciled: 00-plan.md, 01-design.md
2025-11-01 10:22:05 [ChronoDocs] 🕰️  Change log updated successfully.
```

---

## 15 — Closing humility note (preserved)

This PRD intentionally leaves room for a smarter future implementer to improve defaults, refine trade-offs, and add tests. If you want, I can also produce a starter repo scaffold (module templates + minimal tests) to hand off.

---

# Part B — Comprehensive PRD for an AI implementer (future agent)

> This section is written for the future AI (you) who will implement `chronodocs`. You are expected to be smarter and more capable than the authoring agent. The goal here is to lay out a thorough, actionable, but non-dogmatic plan that you can adapt.

---

## B1 — Project goals & success criteria

**Primary goal**
Ship a robust, well-tested CLI tool `chronodocs` that watches configured phase directories, reconciles numeric prefixes by stable creation order, tracks content changes, and outputs a clear Markdown change log. The tool must be safe to run in repos where an autonomous agent writes documentation.

**Success criteria**

- All required functions implement the contracts described below and pass unit/integration tests.
- E2E tests exercising a simulated autonomous agent show:
    - Indices updated correctly.
    - Single change-log run per burst (debounce works).
    - No persistent self-trigger loops.

- Production-quality code, packaging, and CI integration.

---

## B2 — Non-prescriptive implementation approach (high-level design choices)

I will not insist on a single implementation technology or test framework. The following are suggestions (not mandates) to guide implementation; pick what's practical:

- Language: Python 3.10+ recommended for cross-platform compatibility and mature ecosystem (watchdog, pytest, click). If you prefer Rust/Go for performance, ensure testability and cross-platform support remain strong.
- CLI: `click` or `argparse` for Python; ensure well-documented help text.
- FS watching: `watchdog` (Python) for cross-platform events; ensure debouncing is implemented at application-level (not solely relying on underlying watchers).
- Tests: `pytest` with fixtures for git repos (use `gitpython` or subprocess calls to `git`); use `freezegun` or time mocks for deterministic time tests.
- Hashing: use SHA-256 for content hashes.
- JSON schema: keep versions; include `schema_version` in index files to support migrations.
- Logging: Python `structlog` or standard `logging` with JSON option.

---

## B3 — Concrete module contracts & signatures

(These are suggested function signatures — you can adapt names but keep contracts.)

### config

- `load_config(path: Optional[Path]) -> Config`
    - Resolves config file, env vars, CLI overrides. Return dataclass `Config`.

### creation_index

- `load_creation_index(path: Path) -> CreationIndex`
- `save_creation_index(path: Path, index: CreationIndex) -> None`
- `record_creation(entry: CreationEntry) -> None`
- **Keying**: provide `key_for_path(path: Path, stat: os.stat_result) -> str` (inode/dev preferred with `name:` fallback).

### update_index

- `load_update_index(path: Path) -> UpdateIndex`
- `save_update_index(path: Path, idx: UpdateIndex) -> None`
- `compute_hash(path: Path) -> str` (SHA-256)
- `maybe_update_hash(path: Path, idx: UpdateIndex) -> Optional[UpdateEntry]` (update only when content changed).

### reconciler

- `reconcile_prefixes(phase_dir: Path, dry_run: bool=False) -> ReconcileResult`
    - Loads indices, computes stable list ordered by recorded creation time, determines desired `NN-<slug>` names, performs safe temp renames and atomic finalizes, updates indices.

**ReconcileResult** example:

```py
@dataclass
class ReconcileResult:
    renamed: List[Tuple[Path, Path]]  # from -> to
    skipped: List[Path]
    errors: List[str]
    update_index_changes: Dict[str, UpdateEntry]
```

### change_log

- `generate_change_log(root: Path, output: Path, config: Config) -> GenerateResult`
    - Uses `git --porcelain -z` parsing helper to compute statuses, uses creation/update indices for dates, groups and writes markdown.

### watcher_phase

- `PhaseWatcher(phase_dir: Path, reconcile_cb: Callable, debounce: float, ignore: Iterable[str])`
    - Non-recursive; handles reentrancy via lock file or in-process mutex.

### watcher_root

- `RootWatcher(root_paths: List[Path], schedule_generate: Callable, debounce_root: float, ignore: Iterable[str])`
    - Recursive; schedules change log generation on meaningful root changes.

### cli

- `main(argv)` builds CLI and maps commands to module functions; sets logging & metrics.

---

## B4 — Testing plan (implements & expands earlier list)

### Unit tests (fast, pure)

- Config parsing, CLI flag mapping.
- `should_ignore_path` permutations with many inputs.
- Hash computation on sample files.
- JSON load/save with corrupted input (expect recoverable errors).
- `compute_stable_ctime` with mocked `os.stat`.
- `git_helpers.parse_porcelain` with crafted samples.

### Integration tests (real git)

- Create temporary repo with `git init` and simulate commits, staged, unstaged, untracked files. Use the real `git` binary for authenticity.
- Test `generate_change_log` output content and link correctness.
- Reconcile integration: create unsuffixed files and verify rename behavior.

### Watcher integration

- Run watcher in subprocess with controlled environment; simulate FS events via file writes and renames.
- Assert single debounce-triggered reconcile / generate calls.

### Property & fuzz tests

- Generate random filenames and contents; ensure indices maintain invariants.

### Test harness utilities

- Provide helper to create temp git repo + function `commit_all(repo, message)` for tests.
- Use deterministic wall-clock via `freezegun` or manually set mtime on created files to make output deterministic.

---

## B5 — Observability & operationalization

- Expose metrics via logs and optional Prometheus endpoint.
- Implement a `--status-json` output for `chronodocs status`.
- Provide `--dry-run` and `--verbose` to support debugging and test assertions.
- Provide `trace_id` in logs for a reconcile/generate run to correlate log lines.

---

## B6 — Packaging & distribution

- Python: publish as PyPI package `chronodocs` with console script entry point `chronodocs`.
- Provide `pip install .` dev workflow and a Dockerfile for running as containerized watcher.
- Provide systemd service unit example or README instructions for running as a daemon.

---

## B7 — CI & release

- CI pipelines:
    - Linting (ruff/flake8), type-checking (mypy), unit tests, integration tests (matrix: linux, macos).
    - Optional: run quick subset on Windows runner.

- Release: tag-based release; publish to PyPI (or internal registry) if desired.

---

## B8 — Backwards compatibility & migration

- Include `schema_version` in indices; migration helper `migrate_creation_index(old) -> new`.
- Back up index files before writing a new schema version.

---

## B9 — Security review checklist

- Sanitize any filenames used in shell commands (avoid shell interpolation).
- Default to limited permission writes — don't change file ownership or permissions unexpectedly.
- Document and optionally enforce `--allow-gitignore-modify` before automatically modifying `.gitignore`.

---

## B10 — Developer / contributor experience

- README with quickstart: install, init, run watcher, sample phase flow.
- CONTRIBUTING.md with testing instructions and coding standards.
- Provide `scripts/` to run test fixtures (e.g., `scripts/run-e2e.sh`) and to create sample repos for local dev.

---

## B11 — Example implementation roadmap (concrete tasks)

1. Scaffold repository and packaging.
2. Implement `config` dataclass and CLI skeleton.
3. Implement `git_helpers` porcelain parser and tests.
4. Implement `creation_index` and `update_index` with unit tests.
5. Implement `reconciler.reconcile_prefixes` with dry-run and atomic rename support; unit + integration tests.
6. Implement `change_log.generate` with markdown template and unit tests.
7. Implement watchers (phase + root) with debounce and tests (integration).
8. Finish CLI glue, logging, metrics, health endpoint.
9. Add extensive tests (property/fuzz) and CI pipeline.
10. Polish docs, package, and release candidate.

---

## B12 — Acceptance criteria for AI implementer

- Code passes unit and integration tests described above.
- Demonstrated E2E scenario where an autonomous agent creates docs, ChronoDocs fixes prefixes, and a single change-log documents the changes.
- No infinite feedback loop in watcher+generator cycle.
- Tool is packaged and runnable with `chronodocs` entrypoint and has comprehensive README and tests.

---

## B13 — Open questions for future-you to decide (and how to evaluate)

1. **Index storage format** — JSON is easier; SQLite scales. Evaluate by: expected number of files and concurrency. If >100k files or concurrent writes from multiple processes, consider SQLite.
2. **Keying strategy** — inode vs path: choose inode for local robustness; maintain mapping for portability. Evaluate by cloning scenario tests.
3. **Auto-update `.gitignore`** — may surprise users: make opt-in; provide thorough prompts.
4. **File rename collision policy** — safe default: abort reconcile with clear error and suggestion; provide configurable policy (overwrite, bump-suffix).
5. **Follow symlinks** — default: do not follow outside phase dir. Evaluate with users with symlink-based workflows.

---

## B14 — Notes to future implementer (humble suggestions)

- You are smarter than I am. Treat this PRD as scaffolding. When you encounter contradictions, prefer data and reproducibility. Add tests that reflect real-world behavior of editors and the autonomous developer agent.
- Make the config and behavior discoverable and reversible (e.g., `chronodocs explain-config`, `chronodocs dry-run`).
- Document any non-default choices in a `DESIGN.md` with rationale so later readers (and agents) can understand decisions.

---

## B15 — Sample "mission & vision" one-pager for ChronoDocs (optional, short)

**ChronoDocs — Mission**
To silently guard the temporal integrity of living documentation: keep files ordered, changes visible, and accidental entropy low so both human and autonomous collaborators can read a clear history of progress.

**ChronoDocs — Vision**
A minimal, reliable sentinel embedded in each repo that ensures documentation remains discoverable, chronological, and self-healing — enabling teams and agents to cooperate safely.

---

# Final notes & offer

I've converted your PRD to a `chronodocs`-focused, standalone CLI specification and created a comprehensive implementation-oriented PRD for a future AI engineer to follow. I deliberately left several architectural choices open and flagged them for empirical evaluation. I also included the system-prompt snippet for developer agents and a concrete test-and-deliverable roadmap.

If you want next:

- I can generate a starter repo scaffold (Python package skeleton, CLI entrypoint stub, basic tests & CI recipe).
- Or produce a concrete test fixture (shell script / Python test) that simulates an autonomous agent creating docs and demonstrates reconcile + change-log.

Which of those would you like me to produce now? (If you prefer the scaffold, I’ll include code templates, tests, and a sample README.)
